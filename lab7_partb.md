Some advantages of trees is that they are ordered and the look up time is fast.
A disadvantage is it takes longer to sort than a hash table.
The advantage of a hash table is the even distribution of data and the fast ordering.
But a disadvantage is a hash table is not sorted and look up time can take a long time.

There isn't much else to compare the two data structures because we are always
comparing speed and effecincy. Since each data structure has advantages and
disadvantages, there is a trade between the two. So it depends what type of
program you are writing will depend which structure you will implement.
